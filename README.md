Dev-Env Requirements
--------------------

- Setup a virtualenv
- Clone source
- Run `python setup.py develop` inside your virtualenv
- You're good to go!

Use infrastructure with Docker via Vagrant
------------------------------------------

To deploy & test the infrastructure on a particular machine, the Docker platform can easily be used.
Docker Engine uses Linux-specific kernel features, so to run it within OS X/Windows a lightweight virtual machine is needed.

If you want to use Docker with Vagrant you need to:

   1. Download Vagrant from here http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
   2. Go into your working directory
   3. Find the `Vagrantfile` sample from this repo placed under `Docker` folder.
   4. Rename `Vagrantfile.sample` to `Vagrantfile`.
   5. From `Docker` directory run:
       * ` $vagrant up funsizeapp --provider=docker`


A fully functional Vagrant container with Docker provisioning automatically installed software has been created.
